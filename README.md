## Rules:
- The turns go in anti-clockwise order (i.e white, black, red)
- A player wins when both of his opponents have been checkmated.
- When an opponent is checkmated, their pieces turn grey but stay on the board, and their turn is skipped.
- When there are still three players left, a stalemate still counts as a checkmate. If there are two players, then the game is a draw between the two remaining players.
- Pawns promote on either of the opponents' back ranks, or the furthest rank directly opposite the player.
- The diagonals are split in the centre along the two same coloured squares of the diagonal.

## Installation:
- Click on the green 'Code' button and click download as zip.
- Save and extract the zip to any location on your computer.
- Open command prompt and move to the directory you extracted the folder to using ```cd {directory}```
- Make sure you have python 3 and pip installed and type ```pip install shapely``` to install the required package.
- Now you can run the file using ```python3 main.py```
